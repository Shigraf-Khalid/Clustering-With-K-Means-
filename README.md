# Clustering-With-K-Means-


Clustering techniques are a set of unsupervised learning methods aimed at organizing unlabeled data into meaningful groups or clusters based on similarities among data points. The objective is to partition the data in such a way that items within the same cluster are more similar to each other than to those in other clusters.

Additionally, I practice all of the basic techniques in this repository using Python libraries.
